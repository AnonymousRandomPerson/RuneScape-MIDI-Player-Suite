# OSRS-MIDI-Player
With this tool, choose any MIDI file and hear it in any of the Old RuneScape Soundfonts. (Higher quality audio than in-game!)

Setup instructions:
1. In the File tab, you want to load a MIDI file. It can be any MIDI.
2. Next, you want to go to the Preferences tab and set a default soundfont. It can be any soundfont as well.

Since you set the preference for your soundfont, it should remember what you wanted when you re-open the application!

# Features
- I completely redid the application on March 15, 2019! 
- The program now supports pausing, and stopping instead of just playing. 
- Rendering a MIDI file to Waveform Audio was carried on from the previous versions into this new revamp.
- A refined custom HQ soundfont based on the Old School RuneScape soundbanks is included.
- The program can actually remember what soundfont you chose by writing the path to a text file and reading it on startup.

# Coming Soon (TM)
- The ability to fix a MIDI file that sounds broken! (It has already been partially worked on and is included in the code, but it is not finished, so I did not enable the feature)
