# OSRS-MIDI-Player
With this tool, choose any MIDI file and hear it in the Old School RuneScape Soundbanks.

Installation Instructions:
1. Download the OSRS Soundfont v1.3 from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx3m4LvdozzGb1UxY1dSc3NOTDg/view?usp=sharing
2. Make sure the soundfont is placed in the "soundbanks" folder.
3. Make sure the soundfont is named "OSRS.sf2". 
Note: If it isn't exactly named that way, it won't get recognized and no sound will play.
4. You should be good to go after that, move onto "Running Instructions" below in the README.

Running Instructions:
1. Simply run the application (Main.java) and wait a few moments, a file chooser should pop up.
2. Select your MIDI file.
3. Enjoy hearing the MIDI in Old School RuneScape sounds!

I am hoping to add more functionality and helpful parts to the interface as it currently is extremely simple and straightforward in the current stage.
