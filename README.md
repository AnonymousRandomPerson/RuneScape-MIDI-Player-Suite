# OSRS-MIDI-Player
With this tool, choose any MIDI file and hear it in the Old School RuneScape Soundbanks.

Instructions:
1. Simply run the application and wait a few moments, a file chooser should pop up.
2. Select your MIDI file.
3. Enjoy hearing the MIDI in Old School RuneScape sounds!

I am hoping to add more functionality and helpful parts to the interface as it currently is extremely simple and straightforward in its' current stage.
