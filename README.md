# OSRS-MIDI-Player
With this tool, choose any MIDI file and hear it in the Old School RuneScape Soundbanks.

Running Instructions:
1. Simply run the application (Main.java).
2. Press "Open MIDI" and choose your MIDI file.
3. Enjoy hearing the MIDI in Old School RuneScape sounds!

Note: the soundfont used should be called "OSRS.sf2".

I am hoping to add more functionality and helpful parts to the interface as it currently is extremely simple and straightforward in the current stage.
